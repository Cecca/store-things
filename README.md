# Content Addressable Store Directory

This tool has one simple purpose: it takes files and organizes them in a directory with names
computed from their content (i.e. this is a Content Addressable Store).

Upon inserting an element (e.g. an image resulting from an experiment) it will copy
the path to the clipboard. This way one can directly use it in a digital lab notebook.
